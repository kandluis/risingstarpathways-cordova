Cordova Application for RisingStarPathways

# Develop
1. `npm install` to install the required pages -- note that the project makes use of Grunt.
2. If the first time running from a clean repo clone, run `grunt init` to initialize and prepare the required resources. Otherwise, simply run `grunt` and modify as normally.
3. Run `grunt build` when you wish to build the apps.
4. Run `cordova run <platform>`

# Thanks!
